# TakistanLife
The famous roleplay mission from ArmA 2 - made by Tonic, overhauled and continued since Feb. 2013 by Armitxes.

Takistan Life is a RPG mission developed for ArmA2.
It allows its players to slip into an endless list of featured roles and jobs as they please. Join the ranks of the Police, United Nations, Medics, Miner, Pet sitter, PMC, Politican, Gangleader, Dictator... or just become the leader of a custom company and excite other players to join your cause!

Thanks to the continuous development and the new roleplay ideas of every player you will encounter new and exciting challenges every day.


## Announcements
**10.07.2016**: Our cooperation with British Borders will not be expanded. As the current state of the mission is stable, the development will now focus on ArmiLife. Any community is hereby granted to continue the project, if you need help in setup please ask for help in the forums.
